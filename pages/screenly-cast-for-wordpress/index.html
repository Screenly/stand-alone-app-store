The goal with Screenly Cast for WordPress is to turn WordPress into a simple content creation tool for digital signage (and for Screenly in particular).

Contrary to some other WordPress plugins or themes out there, the goal is not to convert WordPress into a full-fledged digital signage CMS. Instead, the plugin is designed for simple content creation that can be used assets in your digital signage CMS.
Also, instead of trying to add support for zones, feeds and all kind of other features, we’ve focused on ensuring a good end-user viewing experience.
